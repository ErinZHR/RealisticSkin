# RealisticSkin

RealisticSkin is an experimental project for learning real-time character rendering and OpenGL. The project mainly refers to the Separable Subsurface Scattering technique (http://www.iryoku.com/separable-sss/) and the LearnOpenGL tutorial series (https://learnopengl-cn.github.io/).

The project is intended to provide a space for developers to explore and practice OpenGL rendering techniques with a focus on real-time character rendering. Many features are still under development, and contributions and discussions are welcome!

## Features

Currently, the project includes:

- Separable Subsurface Scattering implementation
- Basic character model loading
- Real-time lighting and shadowing
- Dynamic camera controls

## Getting Started

To run the project, you will need to have OpenGL and its dependencies installed. 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ErinZHR/RealisticSkin.git
```

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome! Feel free to open a pull request or submit an issue if you encounter any bugs or have any ideas for new features.
